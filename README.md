# Dynamic Honeypot Placement as a Game-Theoretic Defense

## Overview Full Information Game
This project models **honeypot placement** in a network as a **two-player zero-sum game** between an *attacker* and a *defender*.  
- The **defender** strategically deploys honeypots (decoy systems) to protect critical assets.  
- The **attacker** chooses nodes to attack in an attempt to compromise those assets.  
- Payoffs depend on whether attacks are detected or succeed.  
- The simulation uses **game-theoretic learning (Multiplicative Weights Update)** to approximate the **Nash equilibrium**, revealing optimal defensive and offensive strategies.

The outcome is a visualization of equilibrium honeypot placement probabilities, attacker target probabilities, and convergence behavior over time.

## Overview Incomplete Information Game
This project also supports an **incomplete-information attacker model**, where the attacker does not know the network structure, asset locations, or honeypot placement.  
- The **defender** deploys a fixed set of honeypots and does not update strategy over time.  
- The **attacker** does not have access to payoffs or detection parameters and must learn purely from success/failure feedback.  
- Instead of computing best responses, the attacker uses a **softmax multi-armed bandit**, gradually learning a stochastic attack distribution through exploration.  

Because the attacker receives only noisy feedback generated by hidden honeypots, the resulting mixed strategy is a no-regret policy, not a Nash equilibrium. The defender often achieves even better long-run payoff than in the full-information game, since uncertainty makes it difficult for the attacker to identify profitable targets.  

The outcome includes visualizations of the attacker’s learned attack probabilities, the defender’s fixed honeypot configuration, and the cumulative payoff trend under partial attacker observability.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Grid Network** | The network is represented as a 2D grid graph (`rows × cols`). Nodes are computers/systems connected to their adjacent neighbors. |
| **Assets** | High-value systems that the attacker targets and defender must protect. |
| **Honeypots** | Decoy systems placed by the defender each round to catch attackers. |
| **Detection Model** | Determines how honeypots influence nearby nodes using a probability parameter `alpha` and neighborhood radius `r`. |
| **Payoff Matrix** | Defines the defender’s payoff for every defender (honeypot set) and attacker (target node) pair. |
| **MWU Algorithm** | Both players update strategy weights using Multiplicative Weights Update until the average strategies converge to equilibrium. |
| **Bandit Softmax** | Attacker learns attack probabilities from success/failure feedback using a softmax exploration rule; no knowledge of assets or honeypots. |

## Project Structure
`main.py` - Main entry point for the simulation. Loads a YAML configuration, builds the graph, runs the MWU solver, saves results (CSVs, plots), and prints summary stats.

`requirements.txt` - Python dependencies needed to run the project.

`experiments/` - Holds config files for each experiemnt created. 

`src/graph_model.py` -  Builds the network as a grid graph, labels nodes as assets or normal systems, and defines honeypot candidates.

`src/actions.py` - Enumerates all valid defender actions (honeypot placements) given the candidate list and honeypot budget B.

`src/payoff.py` - Implements the payoff function and detection models. Computes defender payoffs for every (placement, target) pair to form the game matrix.

`src/mwu.py` - Multiplicative Weights Update solver. Uses log-space weights and softmax for numerical stability, returns equilibrium distributions and payoff history.

`src/visualize.py` - Generates visual outputs.

`results/` - Holds results for each experiemnt.

## Results
**Placement Heatmap** - Bright nodes = higher probability of honeypot placement.

**Attack Heatmap** - Bright nodes = attacker's prefered targets.

**Payoff Trend** - Rolling average of per-round payoff.

**Cumulative Mean Payoff** - Defender's long run expected payoff.
